%DocumentationâŽ¯The final report should include the following elements:

\section{Abstract} 
%describes the goals and purpose of your
%network in 1 page.
\pagebreak

\section{Problem statement}
% A description of your problem, the network design and how it addresses
% the problem in 1-2 pages or less.
\smallbreak

\section{Performance}
%A description of computational performance in 2 pages or less.
\smallbreak

\section{Improvements}
% An analysis of the performance and how it might be improved in the
% future. This analysis should include appropriate statistical methodologies
% in 2 pages or less.
% Important consideration - working with "ideal"/"noise-free" signal;
% real world usage will need to account for noise and for unclear/ambiguous nucleotides
\smallbreak

\section{Conclusion}
\smallbreak

\section{Discussion}
% A summary and conclusion addressing the overall performance of the
% network and what might be done to improve it in the future. This could
% take the form of conjectures, references to other works, etc. and should be
% 1 page.
